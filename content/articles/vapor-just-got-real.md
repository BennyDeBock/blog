What would it be like to make a website in Swift? This is the exact question I was asking myself on January 18th at 5:39pm when I made the first commit to what is now Vapor. Well, almost six months later I am confident I know the answer to that question: “it’s f***ing awesome.”

Amazingly, it turns out I am not the only person who thinks that. Over these last six months, I have met more and more people that think Swift is the future. An incredible community has grown around this project and around server-side Swift in general. I am immensely grateful for every single idea, piece of advice, and contribution that has been made to Vapor so far.

So, without further ado, I am extremely pleased to announce that the #2 top contributor <a href="https://github.com/LoganWright" target="_BLANK">Logan Wright</a> and I are going to start contributing full time to Vapor on May 16th.

Thanks to a very generous sponsorship, we are able to say goodbye to our current jobs as iOS engineers and move on to the exciting world of server-side Swift. Although we can not yet release the name of the sponsor, I can tell you a little about them. They are a team of 65 developers that create mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. With mobile apps comes the need for APIs, so they end up making a lot of them. Currently, they are using Laravel, but they want to start using Vapor as soon as they can. They see the potential to speed up development time, minimize bugs, and promote collaboration between the back end and iOS teams.

Alongside the monetary donation to sustain Logan and I full time, the sponsor will be providing a full time engineer, design and marketing teams, and their CTO’s counsel. In exchange for their contribution, we will be featuring their logo as a sponsor on Vapor’s website and GitHub pages.

Some of you may be wondering, “does this mean Vapor is going to change its license?” Or, “is Vapor going to be different now?” The answer is, no, no, no, and NO! :) Vapor is open source and MIT licensed and it is going to stay that way. The community is what has gotten Vapor this far and we will continue to embrace and support that. In fact, alongside Vapor 0.8, we are announcing some exciting new features for contributors.

## Vapor Evolution

A GitHub Issue template has been added to the Vapor repository. Since we will now have a small team working full time on building the framework, the rate of Vapor’s evolution will increase dramatically. In order to keep the community’s opinions and ideas at the helm, we will enact a proposal, review, and approval process very similar to the Swift language’s. This will allow the members of the community that do not have enough time to contribute code, to still contribute their ideas and decide the direction of the framework.

## Code of Conduct

As the community becomes larger and more diverse, we must ensure that every person feels comfortable sharing their ideas. To help keep the Vapor community a welcoming, safe, and productive place, we are publishing a <a href="https://github.com/qutheory/vapor/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" target="_BLANK">Code of Conduct</a>. We hope this will show prospective contributors what a remarkably kind and helpful community Vapor cultivates.

Thanks again to the amazing work of every single member of the community so far. Your ideas and contributions are what got Vapor here and they are what will push Vapor forward. Here’s to making web development a better place, together.
