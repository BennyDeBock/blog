We are pleased to announce the release of Vapor Red 1.0! This marks the first public stable release of Vapor Red. Since the first beta release, we have added new features, fixed lots of bugs, and increased overall stability. Let’s take a look at some of the exciting new features:

## Native Docker Support

The first releases had mostly focused on using Supervisor to run Vapor apps. However, we always wanted to add Docker as a first-class citizen. Based on the feedback we received, we have now pushed the timeline, and added advanced Docker integration. With this integration, it’s now possible to add Docker containers to an app from a Dockerfile, Redis, or other custom solution.

All Docker containers can be monitored (CPU and Memory usage) in Realtime from the Dashboard, making debugging much easier.

## Billing

We have enabled the Billing system, so under “Settings” it’s now possible to setup credit cards, and upgrade your plan. As mentioned in a previous post, Vapor Red is charged based on a low, flat-rate pricing model. You can read more about the available plans here. With our free plan, you can continue to try Vapor Red without paying with up to 1 server and 1 application.

## Start using Vapor Red

If you want to start using Vapor Red to easily create servers and configure your own Vapor, PHP, NodeJS, or other projects, create a free account through the Dashboard at <a href="https://dashboard.vapor.red" target="_BLANK">https://dashboard.vapor.red</a>
