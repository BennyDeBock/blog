We are excited to announce the production-ready release of Vapor Cloud, a complete cloud solution created specifically for the Vapor web framework.

Experience unparalled performance, efficiency, and availability with the worldâ€™s first Cloud platform built from the ground up for server-side Swift.

## Sign up now

Vapor Cloud account creation is now open to the public. Sign up at dashboard.vapor.cloud/signup.

If you already have a colleague using Vapor Cloud, they can also invite you to join their existing organization.

## Payments with Stripe

You can now purchase Vapor Cloud credits with a credit or debit card or bitcoin. These credits can be used to activate our paid services like high-performance replicas, MySQL databases, and Redis caches. See the pricing page on our website for more information.

## Auto Refill

While purchasing credits, you will notice a new option to enroll in Auto Refill. Enabling this option allows Vapor Cloud to automatically top-up your account balance when needed.

## Thank you!

We want to extend a big thank you to all our beta users. Your feedback has been a tremendous help in creating a stable 1.0 release.
