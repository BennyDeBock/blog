We are excited to announce beta availability of Vapor Red. This marks a huge milestone for Vapor Red, the newest product in the Vapor family.

## What is Vapor Red?

If you haven’t tried Vapor Red yet, it’s a new product that allows you to easily provision servers, deploy web apps, and more, all on your own cloud account. You can spin up AWS and Digital Ocean instances, and deploy your app in just one click. You get all the benefits of being in control of the server, and we make sure your app is properly deployed, quickly and safely.

With vapor.red, there’s no more iron curtain blocking you from your project, you can easily customize and work with your application, deploy multiple types of applications (node, vuejs, vapor, php, and more), create database servers, easily integrate metrics, quick ssl support, and so much more!

To get started, you can find the docs with Getting started guide here: <a href="https://docs.vapor.red/quick-start/" target="_BLANK">https://docs.vapor.red/quick-start/</a>

## What happens now?

Vapor Red will remain free without limitations during the Beta phase as we continue to build out features. On **June 12**, we will launch the official 1.0 release, at which point the system will be considered stable and ready for production usage.

Here is a preview the plans and pricing that will go live on release.
