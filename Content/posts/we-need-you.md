# Vapor Users - We Need You!

One of the big projects we're currently undertaking is a massive redesign of all of Vapor's site. We're doing this for two main reasons. First, we want to provide a great user experience for Vapor's users. Whether you're someone who's never touched Vapor before who wants to evaluate it or an experienced Vapor developer looking something up in the API reference docs, the experience should be great. We're working with a design agency at the moment to ensure all the sites are consistent and look great. We also need to ensure all the information is presented in the best way possible. We'll have more to share on this in the coming weeks, so watch this space!

The second reason for the redesign is because historically we know that we haven't done a very good job of 'selling' Vapor as a solution. There's a perception that it's not 'production-ready' or only for use on macOS, or only for iOS developers etc etc. We know there are companies and sites out there using Vapor that have millions of users and very high traffic. We want to showcase those examples to demonstrate Vapor works across a range of applications, both large and small.

So we want you! If you or your company are using Vapor, whether large or small and you'd like to help showcase Vapor we're looking for your stories! First, we'll have a section for a "Used By" on the main landing page that contains a collection of logos of companies and apps. Second, we'll have "Showcase" section on this site. This will consist of a series of cards with your app or company logo or screen/landing page, name and a short blurb about what you do and preferably how you use Vapor. We'll also link the card to your website as well.

If you'd like to be added, please [tim@vapor.codes](mailto:tim@vapor.codes?subject=Vapor Showcase). I can answer any questions and if we need to tweak things to make it possible for you to be added we can definitely do that!

We hope that we can collate an amazing collection of people, apps and companies to really showcase Vapor being used.
