# Vapor's Contributing Guide

Vapor has an amazing community with hundreds of community contributions each year. To make it even easier to contribute to Vapor, especially for those new to Vapor and working in open source, we've just added a new [Contributing Guide](https://docs.vapor.codes/contributing/contributing/) on the documentation site. 

This covers everything from Contributing 101 with creating forks and pull requests, to talking about how to structure pull request bodies for release notes and finding stuff to work on. It also provides links to our [Good First Issue board](https://github.com/orgs/vapor/projects/10) and [Help Wanted board](https://github.com/orgs/vapor/projects/11) which are great places to find open issues depending on your level.

So if you want to contribute to Vapor, there's never been a better time!
